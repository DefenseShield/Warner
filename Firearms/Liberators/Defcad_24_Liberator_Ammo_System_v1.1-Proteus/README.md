# .24 DEFCAD Printable Ammunition

#### Version 
1.1

#Changelog
* Changed bullet to accept a 5/32 " ball bearing, snap in.

#Instructions
Print the casing and bullet and load with a small pistol primer. Once the round is assembled, insert it into the Liberator barrel
and use MEK to solvent weld it into place, combining it with the barrel. Once the solvent has dried, put the barrel into the frame and fire.

#Testing
This NEEDS to be tested. If you do decide to test this design, first load it with no powder and only a small pistol primer. Fire. If that works,
add .1 grain and keep testing until you are satisfied.
