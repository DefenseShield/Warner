# Trantor Revolver 224

#### Version
v1.2

#### Description

This system was designed as a research tool. If fabricated, be aware of local laws. For additional assembly information, see enclosed picture files. 5 frame pins are required, as well as glue.  

Formats included are STL, DXF, STEP, and SLDPRT. 

#### Notes
Simulations indicate that .22 Short may function, but more than one use of .22 LR may cause deformation. For more information, see "Simulated Testing of a 3D Printed Revolver Cylinder" by J LaRocco, 2013 (http://www.peerevaluation.org/read/libraryID:29812)

#### Disclaimer: 
For US legal requirements, a piece of metal can be epoxied into the space above the trigger (within the frame), and beneath the mainspring. Also be aware of individual state laws. Likewise, components can be made out of metal instead of polymers. A nail (perhaps an 8d/10 gauge or 10d/9 gauge one) can be inserted in the tube above the system for use as a firing pin. Again, no warranty is issued. All usage is done at individual risk.
