# WarFairy Arms Charon Receivers

### Instructions, Order of Operations, Assembly notes and Warnings

#### Example:

"Filename" - start face to end face.

Start face dictates that the face should be against the print bed, with the end face being the last layer printed. Back refers to Butt end, front refers to muzzle end.

These are all suggestions. Anything is possible with different machines, settings and support materials. Experiment and let me know what works best for you.

#### NOTE
All holes and pins will need to be gently sanded and fitted before glueing or pressing into place. Failure to size pins and holes WILL result in cracked or jammed parts. 

#### WARNING
THESE ARE FIREARMS. Ensure all glued bonds have cured for at LEAST 24 hours prior to test firing.

#### WARNING 

THESE ARE EXPERIMENTAL FILES RELEASED AS A BETA TEST. I GUARANTEE NOTHING. YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.

#### BE ADVISED
Our resident guru recommends Weld-all #4 for securing ABS. It will weld faces together permanently, so ensure your alignment. A set of C-clamps and some very straight boards would be a GOOD idea.

### Message From Author

What you see before you is the product of a lot of hours, sleepless nights, and obsessive thought of how to bring the best possible firearms to the internet.  You now posess the data to create seven different firearms (well, ok, six, but the two unbuffered pistols have different grip shapes). Each with slightly different characteristics so you can print the firearm YOU want. PLEASE rename them if you make your own release so that we don't get cross-compatibility issues or anything like that. Chop em up, remix them, twist them, tweak them, make them your own or give them to everyone you know. The internet knows no borders or boundaries. No nationality. No religion. In this stream of 1's and 0's, we are all equal. We are all free. Use that freedom.

WarFairy, out.
